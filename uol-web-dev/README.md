# Web Dev Project
Welcome to the repository for the web development project. This is where all the files are hosted, and where you can do your commits and pull requests.

# Workflow
On Trello, your card should be in "Completed" and the DevOps (Andy) will have to tell you that your code can be merged before you submit a pull request.

# Cloning a Repo/Forking
You need a Github account for this. You can start by clicking "Fork". That means you can download all the files and work on it on your own end.

# Making a pull request (pr)
When you want to submit your code:
  1. Go to "Pull Requests"
  2. Select "Create pull request"
  3. Use your own branch and compare with "main"
  4. Submit and hope for the best
